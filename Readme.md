# 🚀 AI Productivity Portfolio — Ronak Jain  
### *AI Product Manager | AI Workflow Orchestrator | RAG Systems | Agentic Automation | Agile Delivery*

Welcome to my **AI Productivity Portfolio**, a curated collection of projects and artifacts that demonstrate my ability to design, document, and orchestrate end-to-end AI solutions for Agile and engineering teams.

This portfolio simulates real-world work done by modern:

- AI Product Managers  
- AI Workflow Orchestrators  
- AI Delivery Managers  
- LLM/Agent PMs  

It includes RAG systems, agentic workflows, prompt frameworks, PRDs, architecture diagrams, and evaluation reports — all crafted to reflect **industry-standard, production-aligned AI PM responsibilities.**

# 📌 PROJECT 1 — RAG Knowledge Assistant  
### *A structured, retrieval-augmented assistant for documents, delivery insights & knowledge search*

The **RAG Assistant** demonstrates my understanding of:

- Document ingestion  
- Chunking strategies  
- Embedding generation  
- Semantic & hybrid retrieval  
- Hallucination reduction  
- RAG evaluation using RAGAS  
- Grounded answer generation  

This project simulates how enterprises use internal knowledge copilots for PMs, engineers, support teams, and delivery workflows.

### 🔧 Features  
- Semantic retrieval over uploaded documents  
- Precision chunking strategy  
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)  
- Grounded answers only (no hallucinations)  
- Evaluation framework (Precision/Recall/Groundedness)  
- Safety & fallback handling  

### 🧠 High-Level Architecture  
```
User Query → Retriever → Vector DB → LLM Generator → Grounded Response
```

# 📌 PROJECT 2 — Agentic Workflow Automation  
### *An AI agent that automates Jira, emails, task updates & sprint workflows*

This project demonstrates my understanding of **agentic systems**, tool calling, orchestration, and delivery automation.

The Agent Workflow system simulates how enterprises use AI to automate:

- Jira ticket updates  
- Email drafting  
- Status summaries  
- Escalation decisions  
- Action item extraction  
- Multi-step workflow orchestration  

### 🔧 Features  
- Planner & executor agents  
- Tool-calling with JSON schemas  
- Memory store for context persistence  
- Retry & fallback logic  
- Decision-making agent  
- Workflow evaluation tests  

### 🧠 High-Level Architecture  
```
User Input 
   → Planner Agent 
       → Tool Call (Jira/Email/DB) 
           → Observation 
               → Executor Agent 
                   → Final Output
```
