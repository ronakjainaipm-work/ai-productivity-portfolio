# 📌 PROJECT 1 — RAG Knowledge Assistant  
### *Enterprise Retrieval-Augmented AI for Knowledge Search, Ticket Support & Delivery Insights*

The **RAG Assistant** is a retrieval-augmented AI system that:

✔ Reads internal documents (SOPs, PRDs, Jira exports, Knowledge Base)  
✔ Breaks them into chunks  
✔ Generates embeddings  
✔ Retrieves relevant context  
✔ Produces grounded, hallucination-free answers  
✔ Evaluates answer quality using RAGAS  

### 🔧 Features  
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword)  
- Precision chunking  
- External document ingestion  
- RAGAS evaluation  
- Safety + grounding checks  
- Markdown-formatted outputs  

### 📂 Folder Structure
